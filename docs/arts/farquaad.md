# Lord Farquaad, Shrek the Musical

My sophomore year, I played **Lord Farquaad** in *Shrek the Musical* at Charlotte Latin School. I was a Blumey Awards Best Actor Finalist for my performance.

Here is a video of the number *"What's Up Duloc?"*

I enjoyed this role so much that, during [Fab Academy](../projects/fab-academy/disability-forewarning-system.md), I made a Farquaad sticker on the vinyl cutter!
