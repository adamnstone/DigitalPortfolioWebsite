# Disability Forewarning System

For my Fab Academy Final Project, I wanted to create something that helps people living with Tourette Syndrome. Tourette Syndrome a neurodevelopmental disorder included in the ADA that's characterized by making involuntary movements and vocalizations, called tics, and there's no cure. Tourette's affects 1-in-50 people. It ranges from very mild to very severe. For more information, see the [Tourette Association of America's website](https://tourette.org/).

My tics are mild, but for people with severe Tourette, tics can be misinterpreted by law enforcement as intoxication or aggression, dangerously escalating police encounters. I wanted to create a device that prevents escalation at a traffi stop when an officer is interacting with someone who has severe tics.

So, I created `Disability Forewarning System`. Whenever a button is pressed in the driverside cupholder of a car, a display is lowered into the rear window and an e-paper display flashes, displaying a message that informs an officer that the driver has Tourette Syndrome.
