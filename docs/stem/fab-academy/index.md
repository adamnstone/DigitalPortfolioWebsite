[Fab Academy](https://fabacademy.org/) is a five-month digital fabrication course led by [MIT Professor Neil Gershenfeld](https://ng.cba.mit.edu/) focused on rapid-prototyping. 

I graduated from Fab Academy during my sophomore year of high school. Charlotte Latin School is the only high school Fab Lab in the world to participate in Fab Academy. Students learn to use all equipment in a Fab Lab, including laser cutters, 3D printers, CNC machines, and PCB board mills, as well as develop proficiency in digital fabrication skills, such as PCB design and production, surface-mount soldering, CAD, embedded programming, networking and communications, and interfacing. Students complete weekly projects, as well as a final project that showcases all the skills learned throughout the five-month course.
