# Fab Academy

[Fab Academy](https://fabacademy.org/) is a five-month digital fabrication course led by [MIT Professor Neil Gershenfeld](https://ng.cba.mit.edu/) focused on rapid-prototyping. Students create weekly projects, each focused on a digital fabrication skill ranging from 3D Printing to Molding & Casting, that culminate in a final project using all of the skills acquired.

Throughout the course, every student creates a digital portfolio website documenting their projects and course work. [Here is a link to my Fab Academy website!](https://fabacademy.org/2023/labs/charlotte/students/adam-stone/)

I graduated from Fab Academy my sophomore year. To read about my final project, the `Disability Forewarning System`, click [here](./disability-forewarning-system.md).
