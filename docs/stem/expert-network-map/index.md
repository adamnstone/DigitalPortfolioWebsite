# Expert Network Map

[Here is a link to the Expert Network Map!](https://pub.fabcloud.io/project/expert-network-map/)

The Expert Network Map is a network analysis research project to locate hidden expertise in the Fab Academy community and democratize access to helpful documentation.

I was invited by [MIT Professor Neil Gershenfeld](https://ng.cba.mit.edu/) to present this project at the [FAB23 Bhutan: Designing Resilient Futures](https://fab23.fabevent.org/) conference in Bhutan. This conference, focused on using technology to realize a collective vision for the shared future, is the 19th edition of the International Fab Lab Conference and Symposium, the largest digital fabrication event in the world.
