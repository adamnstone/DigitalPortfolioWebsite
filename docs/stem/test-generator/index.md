# Test Generator

The *Test Generator*, a website I created to streamline test making for educators, is in active use by the teachers in the Charlotte Latin School Innovation & Design Department. The website allows for teachers to easily create tests in Google Forms by inputting the test topic and number of questions. The back-end queries the ChatGPT API and uses the Google Forms and OAuth APIs to create a new form in the teacher’s account.

Using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/), I created a website for teachers to easily create tests in Google Forms by inputting the subject area and number of questions. The back-end queries the ChatGPT API and uses the [Google Forms](https://developers.google.com/forms/api/quickstart/python) and [OAuth APIs](https://testdriven.io/blog/oauth-python/) to create a new form in the teacher’s account.
