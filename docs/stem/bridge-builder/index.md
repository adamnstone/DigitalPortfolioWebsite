# Bridge Builder

I created the Bridge Builder, a bridge simulator calculator, that tests hundreds of thousands of bridge designs to arrive at the most cost-effective design capable of sustaining 225kN of force.  

In my Civil Engineering class, students were tasked with determining the optimal length, shape, and material for each beam of a bridge to yield the most cost-effective design capable of sustaining 225kN of force. The class was instructed to input specifications for each beam into the West Point Bridge Designer software which calculated the cost and strength of each design. Through trial and error, I arrived at a bridge that sustained the required weight at a relatively low cost. However, I wanted to see whether I could automate the process to test hundreds of thousands of permutations of the three inputs for each beam to come up with a more optimal design.
