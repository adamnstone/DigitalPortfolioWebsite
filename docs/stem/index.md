# STEM

My long-range goal is to become a thought-leader in creating innovative technologies that will empower individuals to maximize their potential. As a disability advocate who believes that efficient access to knowledge is a critical component to fostering inclusion and productivity, I dream of using science to create a new industry standard in assistive technologies. 

To reach my goal, I’ve furthered my expertise in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science through classes, projects, and gaining hands-on experience as an intern at [Rhythmlink](https://rhythmlink.com/).
