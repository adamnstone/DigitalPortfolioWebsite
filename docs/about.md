# About

Hi! I'm Adam Stone. I go to Charlotte Latin School (Class of '25) in Charlotte, North Carolina. Before moving to Charlotte, I lived in São Paulo, Brazil, and before that, Cary, North Carolina.

My long-range goal is to become a thought-leader in creating innovative technologies that will empower individuals, especially those who are neurodivergent, to maximize their potential. As an advocate who believes that efficient access to knowledge is a critical component to fostering inclusion and productivity, I dream of using science to create a new industry standard in assistive technologies.

I'm passionate about musical theater. Ever since I was very little, I have loved being on stage. When I was eight, I was in my first production as Rodger in 101 Dalmations Jr. Since then some of my favorite roles have included Billy Cane in Bright Star, and Lord Farquaad in Shrek the Musical. I was a Best Actor Finalist in the Blumey Awards for the past two years for these performances, which was a great honor.

The art of communicating is something I also highly value. When I was in preschool, my family moved to São Paulo, Brazil and enrolled me in a local school. Within three months, I was able to learn in Portuguese. My experience living abroad sparked a love for learning languages (I am proficient in three) and also a desire to use language to make connections. 

When I was in sixth grade, I joined the Speech & Debate Team at Charlotte Latin School and have been competing in national tournaments every year since in numerous speech events, as well as Lincoln-Douglas debate. For each speech event, a student is required to deliver a ten-minute, memorized speech around a theme of choice. I’ve taken the opportunity to touch on topics that are very important to me, such as the negative impacts of ableism, as well as more entertaining topics like the American obsession with straight teeth and its greater implications. In addition to being the champion speaker at tournaments held by Stanford, Princeton and Duke Universities, I’ve had the honor of qualifying to compete at the Tournament of Champions at the high school level every year since seventh grade. 

For most of my life I've trained in martial arts. I'm a third-degree black belt in Taekwondo.

I'm also a Youth Ambassador for the Tourette Association of America. In this role, I advocate for funding and research for Tourette Syndrome and tic disorders every year on Capital Hill, as well as educate students and teachers about the condition to promote inclusion and acceptance.
